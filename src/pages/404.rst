====================
404 â€” Page Not Found

:SAVE_AS: 404.html

This isn't supposed to happen.  If you got here by following a link on this
site, `please report it as a bug
<https://github.com/jwodder/kbits-theme-demo/issues>`_.  On the other hand, if
you were just messing around with URLs, don't do that.

(No, this 404 page is not a feature of kbits-theme; I had to create it
manually.)
