About This Site
===============

kbits-theme-demo is a Pelican_ "blog" created to show off & demonstrate the
various features & styles of the kbits-theme_ I created for my blog `"Knowledge
Bits"`_.  The latter blog doesn't use all of the theme's features (yet), but
even what it doesn't use is still likely to be of interest to potential users
of the theme.  Thus, this site was created to demonstrate the theme in full.

Check out the `"Features" category <{category}features>`_ for articles on the
various unique features of the theme, and check out `"Examples"
<{category}examples>`_ for samples of styles and standard Pelican features.
