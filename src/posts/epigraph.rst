:Summary: Just an epigraph

.. epigraph::

    "It was impossible," said the king, looking at the Mathemagician.

    "Completely impossible," said the Mathemagician, looking at the king.  "Do
    you mean---" stammered the bug, who suddenly felt a bit faint.

    "Yes, indeed," they repeated together; "but if we'd told you then, you
    might not have gone---and, as you've discovered, so many things are
    possible just as long as you don't know they're impossible."

    -- Norton Juster, :t:`The Phantom Tollbooth`


reStructuredText provides three directives for special types of blockquotes:
``epigraph::``, ``highlights::``, and ``pull-quote::``.  Docutils' bundled
stylesheets give epigraphs custom margins and do not do any special styling of
the other two types.  kbits-theme styles all three types the same as regular
blockquotes.
