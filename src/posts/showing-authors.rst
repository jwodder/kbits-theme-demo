kbits-theme has two settings for controlling whether to show articles' authors.
They are useful if your site only has one author and you don't want to slap
your name all over everything.

The settings are:

``SHOW_AUTHOR = True``
   Whether to show articles' authors in article metadata tables

``SHOW_AUTHOR_IN_LISTINGS = True``
   Whether to show articles' authors in article listings (``index.html`` etc.)
