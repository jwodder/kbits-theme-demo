kbits-theme has built-in support for the autopages_ plugin.  If you use this
plugin to create a page for a category, tag, or author, the page's contents
will be shown at the top of the article listing for that category/tag/author.
If you do not use the autopages plugin, or if you do not create a page for a
given category, tag, or author, the respective article listing(s) will remain
unadorned.

For an example of an article listing with an autopage, see this site's
`"Features" category <{category}features>`_.  For an example of an article
listing *without* an autopage, see this site's `"article listings" tag
<{tag}article-listings>`_.
