This repository holds the source for kbits-theme-demo_, a Pelican_ "blog"
created to show off & demonstrate the various features & styles of the
kbits-theme_ I created for my blog `"Knowledge Bits"`_.  The latter blog
doesn't use all of the theme's features (yet), but even what it doesn't use is
still likely to be of interest to potential users of the theme.  Thus, this
site was created to demonstrate the theme in full.
